# Project State — Zeker

Single source of truth for current progress. Updated at every checkpoint.

**Last updated:** 2026-08-25
**Last verified:** 2026-08-25 (backend typecheck clean, 27/27 tests pass, live Firestore reachable, deny-all rules deployed, /auth routes live)

---

## Current Milestone

**MVP — Access Management for Physical Spaces**

---

## Current Status

🟢 **Infrastructure Complete — Ready for MVP Build** (Camino B: Build first, validate after)

```
Completed:       Infrastructure + backend skeleton + database locked down
                 + sign-in endpoints (27 tests pass)
In Progress:     Week 1 — Backend feature endpoints
Blocked:         0 · Pending decisions queue is empty
Critical Risk:   None open — the open-database risk was closed on 2026-08-25
Next:            Organizations, then locations + interiors + quota
```

**Latest Update (2026-08-25):** Three blocking decisions answered by the Founder
and recorded. Database access closed.
- ✅ D-002 approved → sign-in happens in the browser with Firebase; our server
  never handles a password. Recorded as Decision 002.
- ✅ D-003 approved → "interiors" become a real level under a location, and plan
  limits move onto the organization. Recorded as Decision 003.
- ✅ D-004 approved and **already built and deployed** → browsers can no longer
  reach the database at all. Recorded as Decision 004.
- ✅ Verified after the change: the backend still reads the live database
  (`/health/ready` → 200), typecheck clean, 12/12 tests pass.
- ⚠️ Found while doing it: the original setup script could never have worked —
  it called a `gcloud` command that has no rules option. The rules are now a
  real file in the repository, deployed with the Firebase CLI.

**Sign-in endpoints built (2026-08-25).** The account side of the product now
works end to end on the server.
- `POST /auth/session` — called once after the browser signs in. Creates the
  person's profile the first time, refreshes it after. Safe to call repeatedly.
- `GET /auth/me` — who am I, and which organizations do I belong to. This is
  what decides whether the app shows the admin, responsable or security screens.
- `POST /auth/logout` — ends the session on the server, so a stolen session
  cannot be resumed.
- We store **less personal data than the original design asked for**: no email
  address and no phone number in our database. Firebase already holds the email
  and sends it with every request. This also sidesteps the unresolved
  encryption problem, and a test now proves the email is never written.
- Verified: 27/27 tests pass, typecheck clean, and the three routes answered
  correctly on a live server (a fake token is rejected by real Firebase).
- Correction: the plan said these routes would get a strict 5-per-minute limit.
  They did not, on purpose — several staff of one customer share one office
  internet address and would have locked each other out each morning. There is
  no password to guess on this API any more, so the strict limit had no job.

**Previous Update (2026-08-21):** Backend skeleton built and verified.
- ✅ Express + TypeScript app running, compiles clean, 12 tests passing
- ✅ Firestore reached live through ADC (`/health/ready` returns 200)
- ✅ Firebase token verification, uniform error shape, rate limits, request tracing
- ✅ Cloud Run container definition ready (non-root, no source in image)
- ✅ Security fix: service-account key filenames can no longer be committed
- ⚠️ Three design contradictions found — raised as D-002, D-003, D-004

**Previous Update (2026-08-19):** Multi-role dispatch validation completed.
- ✅ Backend Developer: Ready to scaffold (48-hour launch plan)
- ✅ Frontend Developer: Ready to scaffold (component library outlined)
- ✅ Architect: Infrastructure 6/6 complete (rules update flagged Week 2)
- ✅ Product Owner: Prioritization clear (Backend first, 7 critical stories)
- ✅ Security Engineer: ADC approach confirmed secure

---

## Completed

✅ **Product Definition**
- Problem statement: Control access to physical spaces (Locations) via entry authorization
- Organization type (MVP): Locations only (schools with pick-up auth deferred to Phase 2)
- Users identified: Admin, Authorizer, Security personnel
- MVP scope: Locations + Interiors management, entry authorizations (QR), validation, trazabilidad
- Free tier limit: 1 location, 10 interiors max
- Out of scope (MVP): Schools/pick-up auth, recurrence, complex rules, hardware, mobile native

✅ **Architecture & Technology**
- Stack decided: GCP Cloud (Firestore, Cloud Run, Firebase Auth, Vercel)
- Multi-tenancy design: org-level isolation, one admin → multiple orgs
- Encryption strategy: AES-256 at rest, TLS in transit
- PWA: Yes (for offline read capability)

✅ **Security & Compliance**
- Data minimization rules written
- Never store: IDs, photos, biometrics, addresses
- Encrypt: Emails, phone numbers
- Retention: 90 days events, 1 year auth records
- Compliance target: Ley 1581/2016 (Colombia)

✅ **Backend Skeleton** (2026-08-21)
- Express 5 + TypeScript app, strict compile, ESM build to `backend/dist/`
- Configuration validated at startup — the app refuses to run half-configured
- Firebase Admin SDK wired through Application Default Credentials (no key file)
- `requireAuth`: verifies Firebase ID tokens, rejects revoked sessions immediately
- Single error handler producing the documented `{ error, message, request_id }` shape
- Request tracing (`X-Request-Id`), structured logs shaped for Google Cloud Logging
- Rate limits per `api.md` (5/min auth, 100/min validate, 60/min general)
- `GET /health` and `GET /health/ready` (real Firestore round trip)
- Dockerfile for Cloud Run: two-stage, non-root, no compiler or source in the image
- Verified: `npm run typecheck` clean · `npm test` 12/12 pass · live 200 from Firestore

✅ **Sign-in endpoints** (2026-08-25)
- `POST /auth/session`, `GET /auth/me`, `POST /auth/logout` (Decision 002)
- The API never accepts a password; sign-in happens in the browser at Firebase
- User profile stores no email and no phone — Firebase holds the email, and it
  arrives verified with every request
- Role is per organization, not global (one person can run several orgs)
- Verified: 27/27 tests pass · typecheck clean · live routes answer correctly

✅ **Documentation**
- `docs/architecture/developer-guide.md` — how to run, test, and deploy
- `docs/product/brief.md` — what we build
- `docs/product/requirements.md` — 10 user stories
- `docs/architecture/architecture.md` — full technical spec

## In Progress

🔨 **Week 1-2: MVP Development**

**Backend (Days 1-7):**
- [x] Express app scaffolded + TypeScript configured
- [x] Firebase Admin SDK + Firestore client initialized
- [x] Request pipeline: auth middleware, error contract, rate limits, tracing
- [x] Health + readiness endpoints, Cloud Run container definition
- [x] Firestore rules in the repository, clients denied, deployed (Decision 004)
- [x] Auth endpoints — `POST /auth/session`, `GET /auth/me`, `POST /auth/logout` (Decision 002)
- [ ] Org CRUD endpoints + multi-org support + membership check on every route
- [ ] Location CRUD + plan limits (Decision 003)
- [ ] Interior CRUD + global 10-interior quota, enforced in a transaction (403)
- [ ] Authorization creation + QR/numeric code generation
- [ ] Validation endpoint (scan QR, check validity, log event)
- [ ] Unit + integration tests for all critical flows
- [ ] Cloud Run deployment pipeline ready

**Frontend (Days 1-3 scaffold, 5-14 build):**
- [ ] Next.js 14 + React 18 scaffolded
- [ ] Firebase Auth SDK configured

**Critical Blocker (Week 2 pre-launch gate):**
- [x] Firestore security rules locked down — clients denied entirely (Decision 004,
      deployed and verified 2026-08-25). The granular per-role design is retained
      in `data-model.md` as a reference, not deployed.
- [ ] Multi-org isolation verified in backend code (User A cannot access User B data)
      — now the *only* thing keeping customers apart, so this test is mandatory

## Known Issues

- 🔴 **Nothing is saved in version history** — the backend code, the frontend
  folder and the newer documents have never been committed. Only the very first
  commit exists. If this machine fails, the work is lost. Fix: one commit.
- 🟡 **Isolation between organizations now depends entirely on backend code** —
  a consequence of closing the database (Decision 004). Every endpoint that
  touches an organization must check membership, and a test must prove that user
  A cannot reach user B's data. Not yet written, because those endpoints do not
  exist yet.
- 🟡 **Encryption plan is not buildable as written** — the architecture says the
  browser encrypts phone numbers before sending them. The browser cannot hold the
  Cloud KMS key. Encryption has to happen on the server. To resolve before the
  authorization endpoints are built.
- 🟡 **Dependency versions are not locked** — `package-lock.json` is excluded
  from version control and the container image installs with `npm install`
  instead of `npm ci`. Two builds of the same code can therefore pull different
  library versions. Small fix, but it affects what actually ships to production.
- 🟡 **Rate limits are counted per internet address, not per person** — the
  general 60-per-minute limit runs before the app knows who the caller is, so
  everyone in one office shares one budget. Fine for now; will need attention if
  a customer has many staff on one connection.
- 🟡 **Error messages are in English, the product is in Spanish** — the API
  returns an error code plus an English sentence. The intended approach is for
  the frontend to turn the code into Spanish text for the user. Needs one
  deliberate pass when the frontend is built, so the two do not drift.
- 🟡 **Requirements read as if already built** — every acceptance criterion in
  `requirements.md` is written as a ticked box `[x]`. They are definitions of
  what must be true, not work that is finished. Easy to misread as progress.
- ✅ ~~Database open to any signed-in user~~ — closed 2026-08-25 (Decision 004).
- ✅ ~~Design documents contradict each other~~ — the three conflicts were
  resolved by Decisions 002, 003 and 004 on 2026-08-25.
- ✅ ~~Two stale references~~ — both fixed 2026-08-25: `architecture.md` now
  points at the real decision files, and `firestore.rules` now exists.
- ⚠️ **Not yet validated with customers** — All assumptions, no market feedback
- ⚠️ **Privacy policy not yet written** — Needed before launch (high priority)
- ⚠️ **Terms & Conditions not yet written** — Needed before launch
- ⚠️ **No mobile app** — Web + PWA only for MVP (acceptable risk)
- ⚠️ **No recurring authorizations** — Phase 2 (acceptable for MVP)
- ⚠️ **No advanced reporting** — Phase 2 (acceptable for MVP)
- ⚠️ **No hardware integrations** — Phase 2 (acceptable for MVP)

## Pending Decisions

Everything waiting on the Founder. One card each. Answering these is all that is
needed — an answered card becomes a record in `docs/decisions/` and leaves this queue.

**The queue is empty. Nothing is blocked on you.**

---

## Approved Decisions

### D-004: Close the database to browsers ✅ APPROVED (2026-08-25) — BUILT

Browsers can no longer reach the database at all. Only the Zeker backend can,
and it already handled every operation. Deployed and verified the same day.
Full record: `docs/decisions/004-backend-only-firestore-access.md`.

**Consequence to carry forward:** keeping organizations separate is now purely a
job for backend code. Every endpoint must check that the caller belongs to the
organization, and a test must prove one customer cannot reach another's data.

---

### D-003: Interiors are real, limits belong to the plan ✅ APPROVED (2026-08-25)

An interior (apartment, warehouse bay, zone) becomes a real thing in the system,
sitting inside a location, with a number and a person in charge — exactly what
the approved offer sells. The old "up to 100 locations" cap is replaced by
limits attached to the customer's plan: free = 1 location, 10 interiors in
total. Hitting the limit blocks creation with a plain Spanish message.
Full record: `docs/decisions/003-interiors-and-plan-quotas.md`.

---

### D-002: Sign-in happens in the browser ✅ APPROVED (2026-08-25)

The browser signs in with Firebase directly. Our server never receives, handles,
or stores a password — it only checks the signed proof of identity it is given.
The three password-handling endpoints in the API design are removed.
Full record: `docs/decisions/002-client-side-firebase-auth.md`.

---

### D-001: Freemium Model (Resource-Limited) + GCP Stack ✅ APPROVED (2026-08-19)

**Card:**
```
Decision:       Resource-limited freemium model for access control

Scope:          MVP focuses on LOCATIONS (not schools)
                Future: Schools as separate org type

Free tier:      1 location organization
                Up to 10 interiors per location
                Unlimited entry authorizations (QR-based, not quotas)

Paid tiers:     Plan A: Up to 5 locations, 10 interiors per location
                Plan B: Up to 20 locations, 50 interiors per location
                (Exact pricing TBD after validation)

Schools (Phase 2):
                Max 50 students per free plan (different org type)
                Schools create pick-up authorizations
                (Deferred: not in MVP scope)

GCP Stack:      Approved ✓ (Firestore, Cloud Run, Firebase Auth, KMS)

Cost impact:    ~$0/month (free tier) until customers grow
Reversibility:  High (can migrate pricing model, ~1 week effort)

Waiting since:  2026-08-18
Blocker:        Data model + MVP scope locked until this approved
```

**Founder clarifications (2026-08-18):**
- Quota applies to **total interiors across all locations** (not per location; global quota)
- 1 user can manage multiple locations within the quota
- Interiors created manually; each interior has:
  - Responsable (person in charge)
  - Number/ID (bodega #, apartment #, zone #, etc.)
- Quota enforcement: Block creation on limit (no warnings)
- Data model: Locations + Interiors separate from Schools (Phase 2)

**Multi-role dispatch feedback (2026-08-19):**
- ✅ **Product Owner:** Quota must be visible in UI (global counter)
- ✅ **Architect:** Will use Firestore atomic transactions to prevent quota bypass
- ✅ **Security:** Audit logging required for all interior creates
- ✅ **UX Designer:** Single global quota bar (not per-location)
- ✅ **Backend:** 403 Forbidden response with user-friendly message (not technical)
  - Example: "Ya tiene 10 interiores. Mejore su plan para agregar más."

**Status:** ✅ APPROVED — Ready for infrastructure setup (Week 1)

---

## Technical Decisions

### Active Decisions

- **GCP Cloud Stack** — Firestore, Cloud Run, Firebase Auth, KMS
- **Sign-in in the browser** — Firebase Auth Web SDK; our API never sees a password (Decision 002)
- **Interiors under locations** — plan-based limits on the org document; free = 1 location / 10 interiors total (Decision 003)
- **Backend-only database access** — clients denied all Firestore access; isolation enforced in backend code (Decision 004)
- **Freemium Model (Resource-Limited)** — 1 location + 10 interiors free; paid plans unlock more locations/interiors
- **MVP Scope: Locations Only** — Entry authorization (QR validation). Schools deferred to Phase 2.
- **Web + PWA** — No mobile native (Phase 2+)
- **Multi-admin-multi-org** — One user can manage multiple organizations
- **Data Minimization** — Never store IDs, photos, detailed addresses
- **Encryption at Rest** — AES-256 for emails, phones
- **90-day Event Retention** — Auto-delete access logs after 90 days

### Superseded Decisions

(None yet)

---

## Explicitly Out of Scope (MVP)

- ❌ Mobile-native apps (iOS/Android)
- ❌ Recurring/recurring authorizations
- ❌ Facial recognition or biometric auth
- ❌ Hardware integrations (turnstiles, doors, cameras)
- ❌ Advanced authorization rules engine
- ❌ Real-time notifications (email only)
- ❌ Multi-language (Spanish only, initially)
- ❌ Audit reports (basic logs only)
- ❌ API for third-party integrations
- ❌ SLA guarantees (best-effort, no uptime guarantee)

---

## Metrics We Care About

### User Acquisition

- Organizations created (total, weekly)
- Users invited/activated per org
- Segment breakdown (schools vs. residences vs. other)

### Engagement

- Active organizations (created auth in last 7 days)
- Authorizations created (total, trend)
- Access validations per day
- Denied/failed validations (% of total)

### Retention

- % organizations still active after 1/4/12 weeks
- Authorization revocation rate (expected: low, means trust)

### Business

- Customers willing to pay (conversion intent)
- Pricing elasticity (what price breaks market?)
- Cost per customer acquisition (if doing paid ads later)

### Technical

- API latency (validation < 2 seconds)
- Error rate (< 1%)
- Firestore costs (stay under free tier limit)

---

## Risk Register

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation | Status |
|------|----------|-----------|--------|
| No market demand | 🔴 Critical | Validate with 5-10 schools ASAP (week 5) | ⏳ Mitigating |
| Compliance violation | 🔴 Critical | Privacy lawyer review before launch | ⏳ Planning |
| Data breach | 🔴 Critical | Encryption in place, audit logs enabled | ✅ Mitigated |
| Multi-org isolation bug | 🔴 Critical | Clients cannot reach the database at all; backend checks org membership per request; isolation test required before launch | ⏳ Test not yet written |
| Firestore costs exceed budget | 🟡 High | Set alerts at 80% quota, scale pricing if needed | ✅ Monitored |
| Vercel deployment fails | 🟡 High | Have rollback plan, GitHub branches | ⏳ Prepared |
| Slow QR validation | 🟡 Medium | Optimize queries, cache results | ⏳ TBD in code |

---

## Team & Capacity

**Current Team:**
- Founder/CEO: You
- Engineers: TBD (building initially with AI assistance)
- Designer: TBD
- Operations: TBD

**Recommended by Series A:**
- 1 Backend engineer (to review + deploy code)
- 1 Frontend engineer (to build UI)
- 1 Product/PM (to talk to customers)
- 1 QA (to test before launch)

---
